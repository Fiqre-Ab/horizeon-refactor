# Horiseon Digital Marketing

## Description

The source code for this project was provided, and I took it upon myself to make significant improvements. I meticulously reworked the HTML code, diligently eliminating duplicated div elements and optimizing the CSS styles. Additionally, I introduced a new section to establish a concise and semantic structure, enhancing both readability and the overall user interface experience.

This README provides an overview of the website's structure and content.
